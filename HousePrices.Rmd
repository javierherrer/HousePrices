## Data preparation

First, the training data was imported through the `read.csv` function.

Then, 10 factors are selected using the continuos description method and filtering by the 10 most related factors to the target.
Before that, factors should have the appropiate type.
The selected factors are:

1. overall material and finish of the house,
1. physical locations within the Ames city limits,
1. quality of the material on the exterior,
1. basement height evaluation,
1. kitchen quality,
1. interior finish of the garage,
1. fireplace quality,
1. type of foundation,
1. garage location,
1. type of dwelling involved in the sale.

###  Variable Analysis

*variable 1: LotFrontage*

LotFrontage is a numerical variable with 259 NA's.  Then we used a histogram and a Boxplot to visualize the distribution of the values of this variable. By using a Shapiro test we observed a non-normal distribution for LotFrontage (p-value near 0).Afterwards, we computed the InterQuartileRange to build the thresholds for severe outliers. 88 outliers were observed,from which 12 were severe outliers. 
```{r}
summary(house_prices$LotFrontage)
# Histogram plotting
hist(house_prices$LotFrontage,
     main = "Linear feet of street connected to property",
     xlab = "Number of feet",
     ylab = "Frequency")

#Missing values
sum(is.na(house_prices$LotFrontage))

# Checking for normal distribution
shapiro.test(house_prices$LotFrontage)

#Univariant Outliers
length(Boxplot(house_prices$LotFrontage, id = list(n=Inf)))
varout <- summary(house_prices$LotFrontage)
iqr <- varout[5] - varout[2]
sev_up <- varout[5]+3*iqr
sev_down <- varout[2]-3*iqr

# Number of severe outliers
length(which(house_prices$LotFrontage > sev_up))+length(which(house_prices$LotFrontage < sev_down))
```

*variable 2: LotArea*

LotArea is a numerical variable with 0 NA's.  Then we used a histogram and a Boxplot to visualize the distribution of the values of this variable. By using a Shapiro test we observed a non-normal distribution for LotArea (p-value < 2.2e-16). Afterwards, we computed the InterQuartileRange to build the thresholds for severe outliers. 68 outliers were observed,from which 34 were severe outliers. 
```{r}
summary(house_prices$LotArea)
# Histogram plotting
hist(house_prices$LotArea,
     main = "Lot size in square feet",
     xlab = "Number of feet",
     ylab = "Density",
     freq = F)

#Missing values
sum(is.na(house_prices$LotArea))

# Checking for normal distribution
shapiro.test(house_prices$LotArea)

#Univariant Outliers
length(Boxplot(house_prices$LotArea, id = list(n=Inf)))
Boxplot(house_prices$LotArea, id = list(n=Inf))
sev_up = (quantile(house_prices$LotArea,0.75)+(3*((quantile(house_prices$LotArea,0.75)-quantile(house_prices$LotArea,0.25)))))
sev_down = (quantile(house_prices$LotArea,0.25)-(3*((quantile(house_prices$LotArea,0.75)-quantile(house_prices$LotArea,0.25)))))
length(which(house_prices$LotArea > sev_up))
length(which(house_prices$LotArea < sev_down))

ll<-house_prices[which(house_prices$LotArea > sev_up),];ll
```

*variable 3: YearBuilt*

YearBuilt is a numeric interval variable. By using a Shapiro test we observed a non-normal distribution for YearBuilt (p-value < 2.2e-16). Afterwards, we computed the InterQuartileRange to build the thresholds for severe outliers. 7 outliers were observed,from which 0 were severe outliers. 
```{r}
summary(house_prices$YearBuilt)
# Histogram plotting
hist(house_prices$YearBuilt,
     main = "year of construction",
     xlab = "Year",
     ylab = "Density",
     freq = F)
curve(dnorm(x, mean(house_prices$YearBuilt), sd(house_prices$YearBuilt)), add = TRUE, col = "red")

#Missing values
sum(is.na(house_prices$YearBuilt))

# Checking for normal distribution
shapiro.test(house_prices$YearBuilt)

#Univariant Outliers
length(Boxplot(house_prices$YearBuilt, id = list(n=Inf)))
Boxplot(house_prices$YearBuilt, id = list(n=Inf))
sev_down = (quantile(house_prices$YearBuilt,0.25)-(3*((quantile(house_prices$YearBuilt,0.75)-quantile(house_prices$YearBuilt,0.25)))))
length(which(house_prices$YearBuilt < sev_down))
```

*variable 4: YearRemodAdd*

YearRemodAdd is a numeric interval variable with 0 NA's. By using a Shapiro test we observed a non-normal distribution for YearRemodAdd (p-value < 2.2e-16). We did not observe any outlier for this variable.

     main = "Remodel year",
     xlab = "Year",
     ylab = "Density",

Boxplot(house_prices$YearRemodAdd, id = list(n=Inf))
```

*variable 5: MasVnrArea*

MasVnrArea is a numerical variable with 8 NA's.  Then we used a histogram and a Boxplot to visualize the distribution of the values of this variable. By using a Shapiro test we observed a non-normal distribution for MasVnrArea (p-value < 2.2e-16). Afterwards, we computed the InterQuartileRange to build the thresholds for severe outliers. 68 outliers were observed,from which 34 were severe outliers. 
```{r}

sev_down <- varout[2]-3*iqr

# Number of severe outliers
length(which(house_prices$MasVnrArea > sev_up))+length(which(house_prices$MasVnrArea < sev_down))
```

*variable 6: BsmtFinSF1*

BsmtFinSF1 is a numerical variable. We observed that some values contained 0 values, but we decided not to declare them as NA, because they corresponded to BsmtFinSF2. In total, we had no NA's. Then we used a histogram and a Boxplot to visualize the distribution of the values of this variable. By using a Shapiro test we observed a non-normal distribution for BsmtFinSF1 (p-value < 2.2e-16). Afterwards, we computed the InterQuartileRange to build the thresholds for severe outliers. 13 outliers were observed, from which only 1 was a severe outlier. 
```{r}
summary(house_prices$BsmtFinSF1)

# Histogram plotting
hist(house_prices$BsmtFinSF1,
     main = "Type 1 finished_square_feet",
     xlab = "Square feet",

# Number of severe outliers
length(which(house_prices$BsmtFinSF1 > sev_up))+length(which(house_prices$BsmtFinSF1 < sev_down))
```

*variable 7: BsmtFinSF2*

BsmtFinSF2 is a numerical variable. We observed that some values contained 0 values, so we declared them as missing data. In total, we had 467 NA's. Then we used a histogram and a Boxplot to visualize the distribution of the values of this variable. By using a Shapiro test we observed a non-normal distribution for BsmtFinSF1 (p-value < 2.2e-16). We observed so many outliers (167), but they corresponded to those rows which had BsmtFinSF1. 
```{r}
summary(house_prices$BsmtFinSF2)

# Histogram plotting
hist(house_prices$BsmtFinSF2,
     main = "Type 2 finished_square_feet",

This is a nominal categorical variable (with 6 levels), in which 43% of the instances are "Cinder Block" and 44% are "Poured Contrete". "Wood", "Stone" and "Slab" levels combined represent only 2.2% of the instances. It contains no missing values thus imputation is not needed. A bar plot is used to plot the variable.
```{r}
table(house_prices$Foundation)
prop.table(table(house_prices$Foundation))
# Plotting
barplot(table(house_prices$Foundation), 
        xlab = "",
        ylab = "Frequency",
        main = "Type of foundation"
        ) 
#Missing values
sum(is.na(house_prices$Foundation))
```

*variable 43: GarageType*

This is a nominal categorical variable (with 7 levels), in which ..% of the instances are "Attached to home" and ..% are "Detached from home". "More than one type of garage", "Basement Garage" and "Car Port" levels combined represent only ...% of the instances. Missing values correspond to houses with no garage, thus ..% of the houses have no garage
```{r}
table(house_prices$GarageType)
prop.table(table(house_prices$GarageType))
# Plotting
barplot(table(house_prices$GarageType), 
        xlab = "",
        ylab = "Frequency",
        main = "Garage location"
        ) 
#Missing values
sum(is.na(house_prices$GarageType))
```

*variable 44: MSSubClass*

This is a nominal categorical variable (with 16 levels), in which 37% of the instances are "1-STORY 1946 & NEWER ALL STYLES" and 20% are "2-STORY 1946 & NEWER". "1-STORY W/FINISHED ATTIC ALL AGES", "PUD - MULTILEVEL - INCL SPLIT LEV/FOYER" and "1-1/2 STORY - UNFINISHED ALL AGES" levels combined represent less than 2% of the instances. It contains no missing values thus imputation is not needed. A bar plot is used to plot the variable.
```{r}
table(house_prices$MSSubClass)
prop.table(table(house_prices$MSSubClass))
# Plotting
barplot(table(house_prices$MSSubClass), 
        xlab = "",
        ylab = "Frequency",
        main = "Type of dwelling involved in the sale."
        ) 
#Missing values
sum(is.na(house_prices$MSSubClass))

## Data quality report

## Profiling

### Determine if the response variable (price) has an acceptably normal distribution. Address test to discard serial correlation.

The acf function in R plots the autocorrelation function of a time series, which measures the linear dependence of the series with itself at different lags.
From this acf plot, we can conclude that the `SalePrice` variable does not exhibit any strong or consistent autocorrelation at different lags, and thus it is likely to be a random or stationary time series.

From the Shapiro test, we reject the null hypothesis and conclude that the `SalePrice` variable is not normally distributed.

```{r}
acf(house_prices$SalePrice)

shapiro.test(house_prices$SalePrice)

(
  ggplot(
    data = house_prices,
    aes(SalePrice, y = ..density..)
  ) + geom_histogram(
    breaks = seq(
      0,
      max(house_prices$SalePrice),
      by = 1000
    ),
    col = "lightblue",
    fill = "steelblue"
  ) + geom_density(
    lwd = 1,
    col = "red"
  ) + labs(
    title = "Histogram for price with density",
    x = "Price",
    y = "Count"
  )
)
